this repo is a collection of notes, fragments and materials to a
possible zsh programming guide.

the default coding style will be the one of the uze project
(so the use of the `@` helpers are recommended) however
the standard zsh syntax should be explained and ksh/POSIX
limitations should be explained when relevant.

this is not a programming tutorial: some programming concepts
and their helpfulness should be already known

* variable interpolation (expansions in zsh)
* lists and dictionnaries (or hash or map)
* generator, on demand
* variable scope, namespace

also: don't expect this tutorial to explain how to pimp
your term.
