this repo is a collection of notes, fragments and materials to a
possible "uze / zsh (and a bit of ksh)" programming guide.

this is not a programming tutorial: you should be confortable with
those concepts

* variable and interpolation
* lists and dictionnaries (or hash or map)
* streams (generators in python), scoping

also: there would be no tips about pimping your term, you don't even
need a terminal. However, the langage used is the one you can use
interactively from your terminal. you can improve your productivity
by reading those notes.
